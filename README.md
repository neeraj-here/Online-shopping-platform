## About:
This project will offer an interface to shop online. Users will be able to choose from the product range available. The website will provide a rich-in-feature interface allowing the user to sort and filter products as per needs and desires. There will be an option of adding an item to the cart, if the user likes a product. To place an order, one will be required to sign-up or login (in case of an already registered user).
